Options available when launching in Nuke (or NukeX) mode:
---------------------------------------------------------

Usage: ./Nuke (--nukex) <switches> <script> <argv>

<script>:
  name of a .nk script to create, edit, or execute
  "-" means stdin

<argv>:
  [argv n] expressions to provide changing arguments to the script.

<switches>:

  -a                      formats default to anamorphic
  -b                      start in background (fork)
  -c size                 limit cache memory usage. Size is in bytes, or append k, M, G or T
  --cont                  attempt to render subsequent frames in the range after an error;
                           if not specified, the application will stop on the first error.
  -d                      set X display name
  -f                      render at full size (turns off proxy; use -p to force render at proxy)
  -F range                Frame numbers to execute the script at.
                           A range can be one of:
                           'A'        single frame number A
                           'A-B'      all frames from A through B
                           'A-BxC'    every C'th frame from A to last one less or equal to B
  --gpu ARG               enables GPU usage when in terminal mode with an optional gpu index argument, defaults to 0 if none given. Will override preferences when in interactive mode
  --multigpu              enables multi-GPU acceleration when in terminal mode. Will override preferences when in interactive mode. It will only work on identical GPUs
  --gpulist               print the selectable gpus and their index
  -h                      print this help and exit
  -i                      with -x or -t use interactive, not render, license
  -l                      apply linear transfer to the file read in
  -m n                    set threads to n
  -n                      don't run postagestamps; don't open windows
  -p                      turn on proxy mode (use -f to force full size)
  -P                      measure performance metrics and show in DAG
  --Pf filename           set filename to write performance profile to after render. This will turn on measurement of performance metrics
  --pause                 initial viewers in script specified on command line should be paused
  --priority p            run the application with a different priority, choose from:
                             high (only available to super user on Linux/OS X)
                             medium
                             low
  -s n                    sets the minimum stack size for each thread in bytes; this defaults
                           to 16777216 (16MB) the smallest allowed value is 1048576 (1MB)
  --sro                   force the application to obey the render order of Write nodes such that Reads can use
                           files created by earlier Write nodes
  -t                      terminal only (no gui); if <script> is a .py file it will be executed
  --tg                    terminal mode,  but instantiates a QApplication instead of a QCoreApplication so PySide/PyQt Widgets can be created. Needs an X session
  -V level                Print more stuff, choose level from:
                             0 (not verbose)
                             1 (output nuke script load and save)
                             2 (output loading plugins, python, tcl, nuke scripts, progress and buffer report)
  -v                      nukev (rest of command line is image files to view)
  --view v                only execute these views (comma-separated list: e.g. 'left,right')
  --version               print version information and exit
  -x                      execute the script (rather than edit it)
  -X nodes                only execute these nodes (comma-separated list)
  --remap r               For terminal mode, sets path remappings from a comma separated list. The remappings will be read as pairs,
                           where the first path in each pair will map to the second path in each pair
                                e.g. -remap "X:/path,B:/,Y:/,Z:/foo"
                                The path X:/path/file.nk will be mapped to B:/file.nk
                                The path Y:/bar/something.nk will be mapped to Z:/foo/bar/something.nk
                           This option will cause an error if there are not an equal number of 'map froms' and 'map to' entries in the list
  --crashhandling enabled Specify 1 or 0 for whether the crash handler should be started or not. By default it only starts in GUI mode.
                           This can also be controlled by using the environment variable NUKE_CRASH_HANDLING
  --nocrashprompt         Disable the crash prompt, so crashes are automatically submitted in GUI mode. This is the standard behavior in terminal mode.
                           This can also be controlled by using the NUKE_NO_CRASH_PROMPT environment variable.
  --                      end switches, allowing script to start with a dash or be just - to read from stdin
